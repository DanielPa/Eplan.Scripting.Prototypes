# ResolveExternalDocumentPath

The inspiration came from Marcus in the EPLAN Community Discord channel. The Script can be loaded an registers an Action that can be called Action in a Label scheme.
It is just a proof of concept and you should not rely on that this will work in later versions of EPLAN. If you want to use this in your productiv process, 
you shoud use the documeneted API classes without refelction.  
I tested this only in summarized parts list in EPLAN 2023.
